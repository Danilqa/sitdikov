# Project structure

Project should adhere to this structure:
```
    /config - files for configuration project modules
    /dev - folder where we store supporting resources, like font projects, scripts
    /src - files used by this application (modules, templates, ligic)
        /components - set of components
            /<concrete component> - folder that incapsulates all component's files
                 <concrete component>.enums.ts - set of component enums
                 <concrete component>.spec.tsx - tests for component
                 <concrete component>.tsx - component logic
        /environments - sets of constants for different application's environments
                    environment.prod.ts
                    environment.ts
        index.tsx - entry for react applicaiton            
                     
    package.json - project configuration, contains project information, dependencies and settings
    yarn.log - file fixing specific dependency numbers
    README.md
    <other root configuration files> - for example, jest.config.ts, .gitignore, ...
